Movie Master is a platform where users can rate and leave reviews on their favorite movies.  They can filter movies based on different criteria and become friends other users on the app to look at their reviews.

The objective of this project was to fully develop and deploy a functional web. To develop this poject we mainly used Handlebars for the UI and JavaScript and Postgres SQL for the backend. 

This code was not developed just by me. It was a class project and I developed it with the help of 3 other team members.
